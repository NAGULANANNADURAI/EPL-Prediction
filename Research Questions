This study's main objective is to analyse and assess several predicting methods for football
games, with an emphasis on games in the English Premier League. The following research
questions will guide this study:
1) How effective are traditional statistical models in predicting the outcomes of EPL
matches?
2) How accurate can football match predictions be improved by machine learning
algorithms?
3) How can machine learning ensemble models enhance the prediction accuracy of EPL
match outcomes?
